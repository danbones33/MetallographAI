## Paper Summaries

### Deep Learning for Microstructure Analysis (2020)
This paper explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for analyzing microstructures in metal alloys. The authors demonstrate a framework that can automatically identify different phases, measure grain sizes, and classify grain shapes. The approach shows a 95% accuracy compared to manual methods.

Key insights:
- Pre-processing methods for metallographic images
- CNN architecture suitable for grain boundary detection
- Data augmentation techniques for limited datasets

### Segmentation Methods for Identifying Grain Boundaries (2021)
A comprehensive comparison of traditional and machine learning-based segmentation methods for identifying grain boundaries. The study found that watershed algorithms combined with CNN-based feature extraction performed best across a range of materials.

Key insights:
- Watershed algorithms outperform simple thresholding
- Edge enhancement pre-processing improves all methods
- Hybrid approaches combining classical CV and ML show promise
